# DTR: Define the Relationship
Use this template when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It’s recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.*
### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:
* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
CSV parsing and interacting with different file types. Delegating tasks to work on individual parts of the project.
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
The team feels that a combination of both tactics will be benificial in the long, however, we feel that paired programming at the start is the way to go.
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?

Trevor: GitHub handle tags and comments.  Wil: Calls over tuple. Jennifer: slack, zoom Alexa: Communicate via slack, unless a call is more efficent(time_zone: 2hrs ahead). Joseph: tuple, slack

* How would you describe your work style?

Trevor: Works best at night, unavailable 6/7 am. Wil: Works best after class(around 9pm). Jennifer: Works best independently and prefers to work evenings. Alexa: Morning person(will work until 7pm mst). Joseph: Works best during evenings will work early if needed.

* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?

Trevor: outlining and planning, critical thinker. Wil: attention to detail, edgecasing foresight. Jennifer: strong logic/ problem solvingand suedo coding. Alexa: refactoring class structures. Joseph: envisioning the layout of the project and github workflow

* What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?

Trevor: Communication went very well and refactoring. Wil: paired programming and communication.Jennifer: paired programming. lack of planning was a set back. Alexa: planning/suedo coding. Joseph: paired programming and communication. Unproductive struggle with a method.

* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?

Daily check-ins(15 min before of after class), project board.

* How will we overcome obstacles?

Discussion and vote if necassary. Meeting each other we we at at refering to schedule and technical ability. Being aware of constructive and kind feedback.

* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?

All of us can agree that planning is a necessity. Consistant and efficent communication. 

* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?

We are creating a google calendar to schedule any restraints. We would like to strive to take sunday off.

* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?

Jennifer: Is intential with her language in order to aviod hurtful feedback. Alexa: Has put turings specific, kind, and actionable feedback in place. Trevor: Would like to find a balance between actionable and kind. Wil: Loves giving positive feedback and would like to give more well rounded feedback. Joe: Intends to give feedback that will help others improve thier code and can be too blunt at times.

* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?

Trevor: can improve with testing and can suedo code very well, allowing for a nice project roadmap. Joe: can improve with time managment and his biggest strength is witing reading readable code. Alexa: I can work on debugging, I often read the error message too quickly. My technical strength is getting excited to solve the little logic problems within the big project. Jennifer: can work on understanding model language better - in the sense of googling solutions.

* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?

Either github project board or trello.

* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?

communicate over slack or if the complexity level is to high make a call. Start with smaller groupings/ minimum people.

* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?

If the pricinpals of oop are followed and test times run efficently we can definitely see our project as a succsess. Also, if work can succsessfully be divided.

* How will we recognize each other’s successes and celebrate them?

Incorparate kudos in our daily meetup. Do a weekend happy hour.

Any additional questions that you would like to add:
### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
* What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)

Minimize social media. Remote office setup.

* When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?

cute baby animals.

* If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like  asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.

Trevor has xfinity that he is willing to share. We can text as well.

* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?

Holding each other accountable by using our apps.

* Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?

couple checkins with our daily meetup.
